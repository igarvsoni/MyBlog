i am a fresher at IIIT Bhopal, where I’m diving into the exciting world of Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. Beyond the classroom, you’ll often find me on the badminton court or playing cricket, as I’m passionate about sports and love staying active. When I’m not playing sports, I enjoy unwinding with a good book, which helps me explore new ideas and perspectives. I’m eager to connect with fellow students, share knowledge, and make the most of my time here at IIIT Bhopal.

This blog will be a place where I share what I’m learning, with the hope that it might help others too. Feel free to follow along, and I hope you find something useful or interesting here!

Looking forward to an amazing journey ahead!
